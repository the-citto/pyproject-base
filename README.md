# pyproject-base

following development of [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which aims to likely replace this whole workflow

one of the most interesting aspects to me would be having the same commands multiplatform (ex. *nix `pyenv` vs Windows `py` launcher)

also following controversies (similarly to [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)'s)

#
